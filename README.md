# Prod3W
### 3W benchmarks 
According to the visual and textual (speech) information, 3W aims to answer When, Where and What is the product sold in the livestream? 
- When:  predict the time of product presentation
- Where: ground the spatial location of product
- What:  recognize the product â€” tell the category and retrieve the corresponding item in Shop

### Prod3W Datasets
To solve 3W benchmarks, we annotate a million-scale multi-modal dataset Prod3W from Taobao Live and Shop with manual labels of 390k product presentation timestamps, 722k product spatial locations and 417k live-to-shop product pairs, covering over 1.8k categories. 

Raw dataset samples are available now, including [annotations](https://tao-prod3w.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/raw_samples/annotations.zip?OSSAccessKeyId=cZpR7MraH7vM2HXk&Expires=11657271565&Signature=hPGtmMt1JSe5z0G6Ew9Svq6p4BE%3D) (74KB) and [images/videos](https://tao-prod3w.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/raw_samples/items.zip?OSSAccessKeyId=cZpR7MraH7vM2HXk&Expires=11657271594&Signature=jfv0ntBD%2BzK6Q8NmAFXMYGYEq5Y%3D) (600MB).
