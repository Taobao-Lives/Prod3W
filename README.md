# Prod3W
### 3W benchmarks 
According to the visual and textual (speech) information, 3W aims to answer When, Where and What is the product sold in the livestream? 
- When:  predict the time of product presentation
- Where: ground the spatial location of product
- What:  recognize the product â€” tell the category and retrieve the corresponding item in Shop

### Prod3W Datasets
To solve 3W benchmarks, we annotate a million-scale multi-modal dataset Prod3W from Taobao Live and Shop with manual labels of 390k product presentation timestamps, 722k product spatial locations and 417k live-to-shop product pairs, covering over 1.8k categories. 

Raw dataset samples are [available](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NUj-3QklBhoyL4pTQPDaY7aiscYBq5bM) now, including images/videos (600MB) and annotations (74KB). Whole dataset will be public after acceptance.
